### Description of the project
The goal of this project is to acheive moving the picture of a dog on a VGA screen of 640x480 pixels at 60Hz and to make it follow a specific trajectory. It have to be possible to move it vertically and horizontally in both directions, thanks to push buttons being available.

## Functional schema of the main process

In order to make the main process we are going to define 3 functions:

* **FS1**
 * Purpose: generate all the synchronization signals
 * Input: 25 Mhz clock signal (*clk25*)
 * Output: *row\_counter*, *column\_counter*, *valid*, *VS*, *HS*
* **FS2**
 * Purpose: define the object to draw and give the information to display given a position.
 * Input: *x\_origin*, *y\_origin*, *row\_counter*, *column\_counter*
 * Output: *spot*
* **FS3**
 * Purpose: generate the color signals for red, green and blue.
 * Input: *valide*, *spot*
 * Output: *R*,*G*,*B*

### Definition of the signals

* **clk25**: 25 Mhz clock. 1 bit.
* **row\_counter**: internal row counter. According to the Basys board documentation (see analysis of *FS1*) the number of lines to synchronize the VGA vertically is 521. log(521)/log(2) ~ 10 bits.
* **column\_counter**: internal column counter for each row. According to the Basys board documentation (see analysis of *FS1*) the number of columns to synchronize the VGA horizontally is 800. log(800)/log(2) ~ 10 bits.
* **VS** and **HS**: they are respectively the vertical and horizontal VGA synchronization impulsion. 1 bit each.
* **valid**: signal for the displayable area. When it is turned on it tells that you are in a valid timing window to start sending the data to the screen. 1 bit.
* **x\_origin** and **y\_origin**: position of the top left corner of the picture on the screen.
* **spot**: binary value of what display on the screen at a precise location. Here it is just black on white. 1 bit.
* **R**, **G**, and **B**: VGA signals for the color information. 1 bit for each.

## Analysis of each function and sub-function

### FS1 (and its 2 sub-functions FSS11 and FSS12)

The goal of FS1 is to generate the signals to synchronize the information on the screen using VGA. We are going to focus on only one resolution 640x480 pixels at the refresh rate of 60Hz.

#### The sub-functions FSS11 and FSS12
* **FSS11**
 * Purpose: count the rows and columns.
 * Input: 25 Mhz clock signal (*clk25*)
 * Output: *row\_counter*, *column\_counter*
* **FSS12**
 * Purpose: identify for each row/column what synchronization signal to send and if it is a displayable area.
 * Input: *row\_counter*, *column\_counter*
 * Output: *valid*, *VS*, *HS*

#### The VGA norm
To display on a screen using VGA the controller need to generate two synchronization signals HS and VS, respectively horizontal synchronization and vertical synchronization. They need to be coordinated with the information to display on the screen.

Historically those signals where used to allow old cathodic screen to aim back the beam of electrons at the beginning of the rows or at the beginning of the screen. 

The clock of the Basys board will allow us to time those signals precisely to sync the display and display the pixels.

The VS signal define the refresh rate of the screen. The refresh rate of a VGA screen need to be between 50Hz and 120Hz. In our case we aim at a refresh rate of 60Hz and a 640x480 resolution.

The Basys documentation gives us all the timings we need to generate the signals:

![](https://github.com/BietteMaxime/remue-kiki/raw/documentation/doc/img/vga-640x480-60hz-timings.png)

So we know that we need to count the columns from 0 to 799 (800 pixels) and the rows from 0 to 520 (521 rows). We will also use the times in the table to validate that our system with simulations.

It is suggested to start with the impulsion of synchronization and after that to start sending display information. By following this recommendation we can draw the following schema showing for each row/column what should be the value of each signal:

![](https://github.com/BietteMaxime/remue-kiki/raw/documentation/doc/img/vga-640x480-60hz-spatial_representation.png)

The blue area is the actual display. The rest is either the synchronization signals or wait time.

Or if we rewrite the documentation in a more logical expression:

* **HS**:
 * 0 when counter<sub>column</sub> = (T<sub>pw</sub>)[0;95]
 * 1 when counter<sub>column</sub> = (T<sub>bp</sub>)[96;143]
 * 1 when counter<sub>column</sub> = (T<sub>disp</sub>)[144;783]
 * 1 when counter<sub>column</sub> = (T<sub>fp</sub>)[784;799]
* **VS**:
 * 0 when counter<sub>row</sub> = (T<sub>pw</sub>)[0;1]
 * 1 when counter<sub>row</sub> = (T<sub>bp</sub>)[2;30]
 * 1 when counter<sub>row</sub> = (T<sub>disp</sub>)[31;510]
 * 1 when counter<sub>row</sub> = (T<sub>fp</sub>)[511;520]
* **valid**:
 * 1 when counter<sub>column</sub> = (T<sub>disp</sub>)[144;783] <br>
   and counter<sub>row</sub> = (T<sub>disp</sub>)[31;510]
 * 0 otherwise

#### **FSS11**: Counting the rows and columns at the correct speed.

The goal of this sub-function is to count using the clock of the board. It requires a series of operations that depend on the clock. Thus, it will be design as a sequential function.

The counter 2 variables are *column\_counter* and *row\_counter*. They respectively go from 0 to 799 and from 0 to 520 with our algorithm. The additional number is because 
*column\_counter* is incremented every tick of the clock. *row\_counter* is incremented every 800 tick of the clock, or for simplicity every time the *column\_counter* is set to 0.

> **MB**: Something that was not mentioned in the original report written in French that I'm translating is why we are counting that way. Why from a 25MHz clock we manage by just counting rows and columns to get a 60Hz refresh rate.
> We are doing so because the number of tick needed to refresh the screen once is 800*521 = 416800 and we have a 25MHz clock that means 25000000 ticks per second. 25MHz/416800 ~ 59.98Hz. This is close enough to 60Hz.

Here is a flowchart that represent this sequential function:

#### **FSS12**: Synchronization signals.

We saw in the documentation the different timings that drives the 2 signals **VS** and **HS**. Driving them is simply achievable by using the 2 counting variables.

We can simplify our rewrite of the documentation that we did below as follow:

* **HS**:
 * 0 when counter<sub>column</sub> < 96
 * 1 otherwise
* **VS**:
 * 0 when counter<sub>row</sub> < 2
 * 1 otherwise
* **valid**:
 * 1 when 144 <= counter<sub>column</sub>  <= 783 <br> and 31 <= counter<sub>row</sub> <= 510
 * 0 otherwise

This function is straight forward and can be expressed as a combinatory function.

#### FS1 simulation and logic validation

In order to test the FS1 function and validate its logic we wrote the following VHDL code:

##### [v1 release of fss11.vhd](https://github.com/BietteMaxime/remue-kiki/blob/v1/src/fss11.vhd)

```VHDL
process (clk25) 
	begin
		if clk25'event and (clk25='1') 
		then
			column_counter <=column_counter+1;
			if (column_counter = 799)
			then
				column_counter <= "0000000000";
				row_counter <= row_counter+1;	
				if (row_counter = 520)
				then
					row_counter <= "0000000000";
				end if;
			end if;
		end if;
	end process;
```

##### [v1 release of fss12.vhd](https://github.com/BietteMaxime/remue-kiki/blob/v1/src/fss12.vhd)

```VHDL
valide <= '1'
	when (Compteur_pixels>=144
		and Compteur_pixels<=783 
		and Compteur_lignes>=31
		and Compteur_lignes<=510)
	else '0' ;

sync_h <= '0' when Compteur_pixels < 96 else '1';
sync_v <= '0' when Compteur_lignes < 2 else '1';
```
